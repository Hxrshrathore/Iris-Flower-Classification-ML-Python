# Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning

This is a simple project that uses machine learning to classify Iris flowers into different species. It's designed as an introductory project for educational purposes.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory to store the Iris dataset.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models (not used in this basic project).
- `src/iris_classifier.py`: Python code for the classification.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required libraries.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

## Instructions

1. Download the Iris dataset from [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) and save it as `data/iris.data`.

2. Install the required libraries using the command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
